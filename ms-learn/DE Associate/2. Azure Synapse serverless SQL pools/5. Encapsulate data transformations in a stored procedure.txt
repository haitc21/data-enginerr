1. benefits:
- Reduces client to server network traffic
- Provides a security boundary
- Eases maintenance
- Improved performance
2. Example: 
CREATE PROCEDURE usp_special_orders_by_year @order_year INT
AS
BEGIN

	-- Drop the table if it already exists
	IF EXISTS (
                SELECT * FROM sys.external_tables
                WHERE name = 'SpecialOrders'
            )
        DROP EXTERNAL TABLE SpecialOrders

	-- Create external table with special orders
	-- from the specified year
	CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE SpecialOrders
		WITH (
			LOCATION = 'special_orders/',
			DATA_SOURCE = files,
			FILE_FORMAT = ParquetFormat
		)
	AS
	SELECT OrderID, CustomerName, OrderTotal
	FROM
		OPENROWSET(
			BULK 'sales_orders/*.csv',
			DATA_SOURCE = 'files',
			FORMAT = 'CSV',
			PARSER_VERSION = '2.0',
			HEADER_ROW = TRUE
		) AS source_data
	WHERE OrderType = 'Special Order'
	AND YEAR(OrderDate) = @order_year

* Notice: Even though the script drops the external table, the folder containing the data is not deleted. To re-run the stored procedure (for example, as part of a scheduled data transformation pipeline), you must delete the old data.
* Solution: Switch back to the files tab, and view the sales folder. Then select the yearlysales folder and delete it (manual delete file in data lake)
