1. Types of slowly changing dimension
- Type 0: Type 0 dimension data can't be changed. Any attempted changes fail.
- Type 1: In type 1 dimensions, the dimension record is updated in-place. Changes made to an existing dimension row apply to all previously loaded facts related to the dimension.
- Type 2: In a type 2 dimension, a change to a dimension results in a new dimension row. Existing rows for previous versions of the dimension are retained for historical fact analysis and the new row is applied to future fact table entries. Type 2 dimensions often include columns to track the effective time periods for each version of an entity, and/or a flag to indicate which row represents the current version of the entity. If you’re using an incrementing surrogate key and you only need to track the most recently added version of an entity, then you may not need these columns; but before making that decision, consider how you’ll look up the appropriate version of an entity when a new fact is entered based on the time at which the event the fact relates to occurred.
2. Combining INSERT and UPDATE statements

-- New Customers
INSERT INTO dbo.DimCustomer
SELECT stg.*
FROM dbo.StageCustomers AS stg
WHERE NOT EXISTS
    (SELECT * FROM dbo.DimCustomer AS dim
    WHERE dim.CustomerAltKey = stg.CustNo)

-- Type 1 updates (name)
UPDATE dbo.DimCustomer
SET CustomerName = stg.CustomerName
FROM dbo.StageCustomers AS stg
WHERE dbo.DimCustomer.CustomerAltKey = stg.CustomerNo;

-- Type 2 updates (StreetAddress)
INSERT INTO dbo.DimCustomer
SELECT stg.*
FROM dbo.StageCustomers AS stg
JOIN dbo.DimCustomer AS dim
ON stg.CustNo = dim.CustomerAltKey
AND stg.StreetAddress <> dim.StreetAddress;

3. Using a MERGE statement

MERGE dbo.DimProduct AS tgt
    USING (SELECT * FROM dbo.StageProducts) AS src
    ON src.ProductID = tgt.ProductBusinessKey
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    -- Type 1 updates
    UPDATE SET
        tgt.ProductName = src.ProductName,
        tgt.ProductCategory = src.ProductCategory,
        tgt.Color = src.Color,
        tgt.Size = src.Size,
        tgt.ListPrice = src.ListPrice,
        tgt.Discontinued = src.Discontinued
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    -- New products
    INSERT VALUES
        (src.ProductID,
        src.ProductName,
        src.ProductCategory,
        src.Color,
        src.Size,
        src.ListPrice,
        src.Discontinued);
