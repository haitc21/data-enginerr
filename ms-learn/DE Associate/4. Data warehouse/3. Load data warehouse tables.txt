At a basic level, loading a data warehouse is typically achieved by adding new data from files in a data lake into tables in the data warehouse.

COPY INTO dbo.StageProducts
    (ProductID, ProductName, ProductCategory, Color, Size, ListPrice, Discontinued)
FROM 'https://mydatalake.blob.core.windows.net/data/stagedfiles/products/*.parquet'
WITH
(
    FILE_TYPE = 'PARQUET',
    MAXERRORS = 0,
    IDENTITY_INSERT = 'OFF'
);


* In most cases, you should implement a data warehouse load process that performs tasks in the following order:

step 1: Ingest the new data to be loaded into a data lake, applying pre-load cleansing or transformations as required.
Step 2: Load the data from files into staging tables in the relational data warehouse.
Step 3: Load the dimension tables from the dimension data in the staging tables, updating existing rows or inserting new rows and generating surrogate key values as necessary.
Step 4: Load the fact tables from the fact data in the staging tables, looking up the appropriate surrogate keys for related dimensions.
Step 5: Perform post-load optimization by updating indexes and table distribution statistics.
