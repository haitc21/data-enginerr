A common pattern for relational data warehouses is to define a schema that includes two kinds of table: dimension tables and fact tables.
1. Dimension tables
Dimension tables describe business entities, such as products, people, places, and dates.
 dimension table to include two key columns:
- a surrogate key that is specific to the data warehouse and uniquely identifies each row in the dimension table in the data warehouse - usually an incrementing integer number.
- An alternate key, often a natural or business key that is used to identify a specific instance of an entity in the transactional source system from which the entity record originated - such as a product code or a customer ID.
2. Fact tables
Fact tables store details of observations or events, ; for example, sales orders, stock balances, exchange rates, or recorded temperatures.A fact table contains columns for numeric values that can be aggregated by dimensions. In addition to the numeric columns, a fact table contains key columns that reference unique keys in related dimension tables.
