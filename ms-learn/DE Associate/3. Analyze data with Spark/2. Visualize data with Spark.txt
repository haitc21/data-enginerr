1. Using built-in notebook charts
When you display a dataframe or run a SQL query in a Spark notebook in Azure Synapse Analytics, the results are displayed under the code cell. By default, results are rendered as a table, but you can also change the results view to a chart and use the chart properties to customize how the chart visualizes the data, as shown here:
2. Using graphics packages in code
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Get the data as a Pandas dataframe
data = spark.sql("SELECT Category, COUNT(ProductID) AS ProductCount \
                  FROM products \
                  GROUP BY Category \
                  ORDER BY Category").toPandas()

# Clear the plot area
plt.clf()

# Create a Figure
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))

# Create a bar plot of product counts by category
plt.bar(x=data['Category'], height=data['ProductCount'], color='orange')

# Customize the chart
plt.title('Product Counts by Category')
plt.xlabel('Category')
plt.ylabel('Products')
plt.grid(color='#95a5a6', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, axis='y', alpha=0.7)
plt.xticks(rotation=70)

# Show the plot area
plt.show()
