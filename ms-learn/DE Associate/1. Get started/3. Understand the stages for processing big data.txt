There are four stages for processing big data solutions:
1. Ingest - The ingestion phase identifies the technology and processes that are used to acquire the source data
2. Store - The store phase identifies where the ingested data should be placed.
3. Prep and train - The prep and train phase identifies the technologies that are used to perform data preparation and model training and scoring for machine learning solutions.
4. Model and serve - Finally, the model and serve phase involves the technologies that will present the data to users.
